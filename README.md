# Introduction to Clifford algebra as an alternative framework for mathematical physics

My bachelors thesis is in Swedish and is too long to translate in a resonable amount of time. Here is the abstract in English:

> This report introduces Clifford algebra and shows how it in many cases can replace tensor algebra as fundamental algebraic structure for mathematical physics. Firstly a general Clifford algebra is constructed from a vector space and a quadratic form. Then we study the geometric properties of real Clifford algebras with non-degenerate quadratic forms. These are called geometric algebras and are useful for generalizing rotations to higher dimensions. Next we explore the connection between Lorentz transformations and generalized rotations in the spacetime algebra. Finally the spacetime algebra will be used to model some physical phenomena from special relativity and electromagnetism.
